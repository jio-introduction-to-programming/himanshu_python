# What is a module?
A module is a single Python file that contains a collection of variables, functions, classes or other objects that are related to a specific topic or task. For example, the math module contains various mathematical functions and constants, the random module provides tools for generating random numbers, and the re module handles regular expressions.

A module can be imported into another Python file or an interactive session using the import statement. This allows accessing the objects defined in the module by using the dot notation. 

### For example:

import math
print(math.pi) # 3.141592653589793
print(math.sqrt(2)) # 1.4142135623730951

# What is a package?
A package is a directory that contains multiple modules and sub-packages related to a common theme or functionality. A package is distinguished from a regular directory by the presence of an __init__.py file, which can be empty or contain some initialization code for the package.

A package can be imported in a similar way as a module, using the import statement. However, to access the modules or sub-packages inside a package, 

### one needs to use the dot notation as well. For example:

import xml # import the xml package
import xml.etree.ElementTree # import the ElementTree module from the xml.etree sub-package
Copy
One can also use the from ... import ... syntax to import specific modules or sub-packages from a package. For example:

from xml import etree # import the etree sub-package from the xml package
from xml.etree import ElementTree # import the ElementTree module from the xml.etree sub-package
